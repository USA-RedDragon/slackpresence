# slackpresence README

Sets your Slack status to the file name and language you're working in

## Features

* Sends language and filename to your Slack workspace.
* More to come

## Requirements

My Slack [app](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=5167321442.546836577892&scope=users.profile:write) is required, you can add it through the popup when you install this extension.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `slackpresence.enabled`: enable/disable this extension
* `slackpresence.authToken`: the auth token for Slack API calls, you usually shouldn't touch this
* `slackpresence.shareWorkspace`: whether to share the workspace you're working in on Slack
* `slackpresence.icon`: The Slack status icon to use. Defaults to `:spiral_note_pad:`

## Known Issues

* There are few features, I'm still learning VSCode Extensions
